Games::Resource - manage resource files for games

DESCRIPTION
===========

This package provides a standard way to access your game resources stored
in files. After setting up the paths and resource hints, you can simple
specify the filename and the module will figure out where the file actually
is.

For some background information, as well reasoning why this was developed and
why in this way, browse to:

Installation
============

* untar/ungzip the package (replace 0.03 with the version you got)

	tar -xzf Games::Resource-0.01.tar.gz

* Check the signature. Download my key from http://bloodgate.com/tels.asc or
  from my CPAN directory. Then do in the build directory (where you unwrapped
  stuff):

	cpansign -v

* if the signature verifies OK, proceed. Otherwise NOTIFY ME IMMIDIATELY. Do
  NOT INSTALL THE PACKAGE! Your system might get compromised!

* Build the make file:

	perl Makefile.PL

* Make the project

	make

* Run the tests:

	make test

* If some tests fail, please notify me.

* If all tests pass, install as root:

	su
	[enter password]
	make install
	exit

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
